The stream opened with a flurry of out-of-character announcements and banter. Scanlan Shadesong launched his tongue-in-cheek “panty peelers” Spotify playlist just as the first of six weekly four-panel Critical Role comics—Vox Machina’s Winter’s Crest Festival by Taliesin Jaffe and Marisha Ray, illustrated by WendyDoodles—debuted. Critmas merch went live: black and green hoodies emblazoned with Trinket, Minxie, Pepperbox and festive weapons, matching mousepads, and restocked “How Do You Want to Do This?” T-shirts. Upon reaching 11,500 subscribers, tier-two perks unlocked access to an exclusive Twitch chat and a giveaway featuring signed posters, D&D gear, Rat Queens graphic novels, T-shirts and cast favorites. Zac reminded viewers that the Doctors Without Borders charity drive remains ongoing, teased a Thanksgiving rebroadcast marathon, surprise stormtrooper cameos in Star Wars: Battlefront, and a Wyrmwood dice-box promotion (code CRITROLE)—all punctuated by Mercer’s trademark pants joke and Liam’s “woobie” quip.

Play resumed at a besieged Castle Whitestone, where undead and Briarwood rebels swarmed the walls. Percy reminded Vox Machina of secret passages beneath the gates; their pact: rescue his sister Cassandra de Rolo and reclaim their legacy. Adopting stealth tactics, Vax draped Anna Ripley in his elven cloak beneath Pike’s flickering spirit light while Grog and Percy scattered fifty caltrops. Keyleth’s Enhance Ability bolstered Percy’s Disguise Self so he could pose as a guard at the double oak doors.

Inside Ripley’s guest chamber they uncovered rugged leather armor with reinforced limb guards, two greater-healing potions, a false-bottom Pepperbox firearm complete with schematics, alchemical glassware and powders, and drums of caustic acid destined for gunpowder refinement. After tense negotiations, Vox Machina secured the Pepperbox, an ammunition pouch and one greater-healing potion; Ripley retained another potion and a Potion of Flying, wearing the armor to symbolize their alliance. Percy’s Investigation revealed a singed portrait of Cassandra and burnt-out letters to Archibald de Rolo—proof of Ripley’s covert resistance allegiance.

Ripley disclosed that the Briarwoods were synthesizing a potent acid capable of dissolving Whitestone’s walls into magical residuum, stored beneath the garden amid ominous green fumes. This substance would power a distillery and enable construction of a ziggurat via subterranean tunnels. An undisclosed backer had promised Ripley land, title and freedom once production quotas were met. Armed with this intelligence and new gear, Vox Machina resolved to infiltrate the castle’s depths, find Professor Anders—the reluctant jailer of Cassandra—and free Percy’s sister.

Vax slipped to Anders’ study door and overheard Cassandra’s sobs and Anders’ threats. Whispering “Jenga,” he burst in, blinding Anders in one eye and wounding him—only for Anders to slash Cassandra’s throat. Two arcane-charged animated armor suits sprang to life. Vax administered a healing potion to Cassandra and shielded her as the rest of the party arrived and rolled initiative.

The early combat rounds were chaotic. Grog was briefly dominated into attacking his allies; the armors, bolstered by Bardic Inspiration, landed several longsword strikes. Keyleth and Scanlan provided critical healing and magical damage, Vex commanded Trinket to grapple Ripley, and Percy’s Pepperbox jammed. In the third round, Keyleth channeled Sarenrae to deliver Healing Word and entangle one armor with Grasping Vine; Vex cured Vax; Ripley conjured a rock-fog diversion and escaped; Percy Action Surged into the fray, repaired his firearm and unleashed three Sharpshooter shots (21, 25, natural 20) that obliterated Anders, his inscribed name burning away. Vax and Grog then dispatched the constructs; Scanlan’s Thunderwave sent one armor crashing off a table. With hostiles neutralized, Vax surprised Keyleth with a confession of love and a kiss, prompting her to cast Cure Wounds.

Zac paused the action to announce that the giveaway had unlocked at 11,500 subs and to tease an upcoming “Snakes on a Plane 2” watch-along. Matt Mercer recapped Cassandra’s daring rescue, Percy’s climactic kill shot, Vax’s romantic moment and the study battle’s conclusion.

Returning to Anders’ study, the party incinerated his corpse—filling the chamber with the acrid scent of burning flesh—then collected Vex’s arrows, the Bag of Holding and 120 gold pieces. They discovered Boots of Levitation (once per day, ten minutes), disarmed a poison-dart trap to recover a bolt, and Scanlan picked a locked drawer to unearth letters referencing “The Undying King,” “we are his blood,” signed by Lord Riskel Daxio—a Tal’Dorei Council member unmasked as a Briarwood spy. A “shit-scry” divination using a jar of excrement (guarded by an elemental) confirmed no unseen watchers.

Cassandra then debriefed: wounded by Briarwood arrows and healed at Pelor’s temple by Father Reynal, she had led a secret rebellion for two years and resisted her captors’ mind-charming magics. Lacking access to Greater Restoration, she drank a minor healing potion to prove her free will and donned her repaired ancestral armor (thanks to Simon). She guided Vox Machina to the underground mausoleum undercroft beneath Whitestone, warning that Delilah Briarwood—a potent necromancer—and a backer known only as “The Whispered One” held court there with a small guard.

Before descending the forty-five-foot stairwell, Scanlan cast Seeming to disguise each PC as Cassandra or Percy (Trinket appeared as a spectacled bear), and Vex cast Pass Without a Trace, granting a +10 stealth bonus. Near-perfect rolls carried them through dimly lit halls—illuminated by Percy’s flaming warhammer, Keyleth’s Produce Flame, torches and darkvision—lined with ten-foot tombs and branching side passages. At the far end, they discovered a breach in the wall: whitestone debris and dark green, grainy glass shards. A natural‐20 Survival check uncovered seven sets of recent footprints leading deeper into the ruins.

As they entered the chamber’s center, the air grew freezing and three ethereal wraiths drifted from the shadows. Only Keyleth, Grog and Vax sensed them in time, gaining a surprise round; after failing their Charisma saves, the wraiths possessed those three allies and turned them against the party. The four unpossessed PCs—Percy, Scanlan, Vex and Trinket—improvised a desperate defense: Percy took cover and used a Religion check to expel his possessing spirit; Scanlan read from a Scroll of Spirit Guardians, halving enemy speed and dealing radiant damage; Vex directed Trinket to attack Grog; and Percy attempted to repair his firearm. Possessed allies struck back with brutal efficiency, while Cassandra rushed forward to assist but failed her attacks.

Initiative reset for a grim, climactic confrontation. Percy’s Sharpshooter shots and intervening daggers, Scanlan’s Lightning Bolt and Mocking Word, and Vex’s Blazing Bowstring—augmented by Trinket’s attacks—shattered the final wraith, revealing the visage of a de Rolo ancestor before it faded. Vax stabilized both Keyleth and Grog, ensuring they no longer made death saves. With the ethereal threat ended, the party paused for a short rest; Scanlan’s Song of Rest granted extra hit-dice healing, and they consumed potions as needed. Cassandra exhorted haste—“We can rest, but not linger”—before leading them into the southern excavation tunnel beneath Whitestone.

Post-game, Zac reopened the charity floodgates for Doctors Without Borders and teased upcoming subscriber goals and giveaways. The cast debated dates for the Christmas “Critmas” special—Laura flagged December 3 as difficult, and Taliesin’s road trip from the 17th complicated scheduling. Zac announced IEShoemaker as the giveaway winner and urged them to submit their address for prize delivery. They previewed tomorrow’s “Group Hug” stream featuring Hector’s comedian friends, lamented that no one volunteered as Purple Man, riffed on Taliesin’s purple costume mishaps and invited surprise from Doctor Who fans anticipating David Tennant’s role. Marisha and Taliesin mentioned singing Gogol Bordello’s “Start Wearing Purple,” and the cast exchanged multiple “Happy Thanksgiving” greetings. Finally, Marisha announced a new comic release next week and upcoming Spotify playlists—Travis’s Thanksgiving tunes and Matt’s final DM playlist—before Zac wrapped up with thanks and farewells.
