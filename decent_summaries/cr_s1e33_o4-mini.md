Critical Role’s community engagement ramped up this week with several new content and promotional initiatives. Scanlan’s official Spotify playlist debuted on Geek & Sundry, featuring cast-curated tracks—from sultry “panty-peelers” to Marvin Gaye—personalized notes and a fan-art showcase. Geek & Sundry also published the first of six Winter’s Crest Festival comic strips by Taliesin Jaffe and Marisha Ray (art by WendyDoodles), celebrating Westruun’s holiday festivities. On Twitch, Critical Role eclipsed 11,500 subscribers, unlocking giveaways of signed posters, D&D gear, Rat Queens graphic novels, T-shirts and other cast “Favorite Things.” Meanwhile the Geek & Sundry store added Kenneth’s black-and-green Critmas hoodies and reissued “How Do You Want to Do This?” T-shirts and mouse pads. Viewers were reminded to follow @CriticalRole on Twitter, support Doctors Without Borders, and note that next Thursday’s slot will feature a Thanksgiving rebroadcast marathon before new episodes resume. Cross-promotions this week included Matt Mercer and Marisha Ray voicing stormtroopers in Star Wars: Battlefront and a Wyrmwood Gaming code “CritRole” for free shipping on premium wooden dice boxes.

In‐game, Vox Machina executed Percy’s secret tunnel infiltration of Castle Whitestone to overthrow the Briarwoods, spark a townsfolk uprising and rescue Cassandra. After Keyleth Dispelled Magic to free Anna—a one-armed alchemist siphoning acid and residuum for a hidden ziggurat—Anna traded her battered armor, prototype pepperbox and sealed vials for Percy’s black powder, ammunition, a greater healing potion and a potion of flying. Using Elven Mantle, scattered caltrops and Percy’s Enhance Ability-boosted shapeshift, the party breached Cassandra’s chamber, where Percy’s natural-20 Investigation uncovered a burned Rolo family portrait and unsent letters to Archibald de Rolo. In Professor Anders’s study they ambushed him holding Cassandra at knifepoint: Percy blinded and mortally wounded Anders, then with Bardic Inspiration, Magic Missiles, Thunderwave, Scanlan’s Counterspell, Grog’s flaming warhammer and other coordinated attacks they defeated two arcane-animated armor suits. After stabilizing Cassandra—now in her mother’s repaired armor—and reviving Vax (who offered an awkward kiss to Keyleth), they looted 120 gp, Boots of Levitation, a poisoned crossbow bolt, disabled a poison-dart trap and recovered a letter naming council member Lord Riskel Daxio as a Briarwood spy. Ripley the undead ally fled into the uprising and Grog incinerated Anders’s corpse.

Reunited and prepared to press on, the group tested Scanlan’s crude scrying jar, loaded Ripley’s pistol, used Insight and a disguised healing-potion check to confirm Cassandra’s loyalty, debated Helm of Restoration versus Greater Restoration, and employed Scanlan’s Seeming to disguise themselves. Cassandra then recounted her Briarwood captivity, years of library research, her role co-founding the rebellion with Yennen and Archibald de Rolo, and warned of traps, patrols and a mysterious ally known only as “The Whispered One.” After casting Pass Without a Trace, they descended by torchlight and warhammer flame into the de Rolo mausoleum, finding eight empty tombs, a newly dug 15–20-ft tunnel, dark green crystalline shards and seven sets of footprints.

Three ethereal spirits then emerged and possessed Keyleth and Percy. Vox Machina countered with Spirit Guardians, Thunderwave, Scanlan’s Cutting Words, Vex’s Blazing Bowstring and coordinated strikes, ultimately banishing the spirits—one revealing itself as a de Rolo—though the broader threat remains. After stabilizing Percy and Keyleth with Healing Word and a DC 18 Medicine check, they took a short rest bolstered by Scanlan’s Song of Rest, with Cassandra urging haste. As the session closed, Vox Machina resumed their southbound descent beneath Whitestone amid teases of upcoming breaks, Critmas scheduling and a charity giveaway.

Off-camera updates included confirmation of scheduling constraints—difficulty on December 3 and Taliesin’s unavailability after the 17th—plus the announcement of contest winner “IEShoemaker,” who was instructed to send their address for prize delivery. Tomorrow’s “Group Hug” stream was teased, featuring Hector’s comedian friends role-playing Jessica Jones/Alias characters (sans Purple Man), with promises of David Tennant impressions, Taliesin’s cosplay and a “Start Wearing Purple” sing-along, capped by Matt Mercer’s Doctor Who fan quip. Hosts signed off by confirming the next live episode in two weeks, a new comic strip next week, Travis’s Thanksgiving playlist, Matt Mercer’s Critmas playlist and exchanging holiday greetings.
