Critical Role is a weekly live-streamed Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition game hosted by Matthew Mercer on Geek & Sundry’s Twitch every Thursday at 7:00pm PST, featuring eight professional voice actors playing a custom, fun-focused variant of D&D 5e evolved from Pathfinder. Ashley Johnson (Pike) missed this episode due to receiving a BAFTA award, illustrating flexible attendance. The players portray Grog Strongjaw (exiled goliath barbarian), Keyleth (half-elf druid on her Aramente rite), Percy (noble-born gunslinger), Scanlan (charismatic gnome bard), Tiberius (red dragonborn sorcerer), Vax’ildan (half-elf rogue, orphaned twin), and Vex’ahlia (half-elf ranger with bear Trinket).

The party was summoned by a dark vision to locate Lady Kima of Vord in Kraghammer, a dwarven city carved inside a mountain. They gained entry with official paperwork from Allura, aided by Orion Acaba and Pike for Dwarvish translation. En route, Grog diplomatically averted an ambush by barbarian goliaths. Lady Kima’s last known location was the Keystone Quarry, a mithral mine owned by Lord Nostoc Greyspine, whose family is notorious for exploitative mining practices. Kraghammer’s magical protections are maintained by House Thunderbrand, while The Carvers, the city’s strict guard, enforce laws and caution against unauthorized actions, particularly at night in affluent areas.

Initially lodged in the rough Pig Pits, the party relocated to the Iron Hearth Tavern, negotiating 100 gold for five rooms over a week. Their strategy involved investigating the heavily guarded Greyspine Manor, the Firebrook Inn (Lady Kima’s last lodging), and seeking dwarven allies to secure an audience with Lord Nostoc. Vex’ahlia and Vax’ildan’s scouting near Greyspine Manor was detected by The Carvers, but diplomacy prevented conflict. Tiberius’s visit to House Thunderbrand triggered magical rune traps; attempts to breach enchanted doors with magic failed. The party dealt cautiously with The Carvers through persuasion and intimidation, receiving warnings about night wandering and social tensions, including risks of mugging and arrests.

For leisure, Grog and Scanlan visited The Stone’s Pillow brothel where Trinket caused disturbances and was pushed into a fighting ring. Keyleth protected Trinket by casting fog, polymorphing the bear into a mouse, and then transforming herself into a bear to entertain crowds with party music and fireworks, restoring a festive atmosphere. They met Balgus, a drunken champion fighter and brewery owner resentful of the Greyspine family; Scanlan sobered him and negotiated a trade of a rare bloodthistle wine barrel for dragon blood, though the barrel exceeded the bag of holding’s capacity. They entrusted mouse-Trinket to tavern care and considered impersonating the local Howell family for enhanced reconnaissance and diplomacy.

Inside Greyspine Manor, Magrim, a strict dwarf servant, only allowed entry with political approval and directed them towards negotiating mining contracts at the quarry. Scanlan infiltrated invisibly, exploring dwarven decor and a music room with traditional instruments but failed to pick locked bedroom doors without thieves’ tools, exiting via Dimension Door. Tiberius discovered a forgotten chamber containing books and maps about legendary artifacts dismissed by the high council as fanciful; he fabricated a diplomatic mission to explore other realms for these artifacts.

Ahead of meeting Lord Nostoc, the party presented a rare ale tailored to dwarven tastes; Orion cast Stoneskin on the group for protection. The Carvers, initially wary, showed intrigue regarding the gift. Nostoc drank the ale as a power display, granted a brief audience, warned against theft or interference with fatal consequences, but allowed passage into the quarry under Carvers’ guard. The meeting ended with a bell marking its close.

Inside the grim, soot-filled mine, repeated bell ringing signaled distress as injured dwarves fled and goblins charged out, sparking combat. The party coordinated ranged attacks and spells, including Fireball and Entangle. Tiberius’s Fireball decimated many goblins but also caused collateral dwarf injuries. Two large ogre-like creatures joined the battle; Percy critically hit an ogre with his gun "Bad News." Tiberius used Fireball and Telekinesis to control ogres; Vex’ahlia applied Hunter’s Mark and Lightning Arrow, killing and wounding ogres. Grog raged, killing several goblins; Vax’ildan finished the remaining ogre with a critical sneak attack. Goblins fled, fearing a greater unknown threat behind the ogres. The party maintained strategic positions for further combat.

To buy time against this unknown menace, the party sealed a mine entrance with Wall of Stone; dwarven guards watched without engagement, revealing awareness of strange abominations attacking. The reinforced stone wall cracked under repeated impacts in a large, high-ceilinged, brazier-lit chamber. The party used stealth and magical protections, including Stoneskin.

A large, grotesque naga-like abomination with five sewn-on heads breached the wall and initiated combat. The battle featured detailed roleplay and tactical mechanics: Tiberius cast Scorching Ray, scoring a critical natural 20; Vex’ahlia employed blazing bowstring and Hunter’s Mark; Grog threw his chain-attached greataxe but struggled to retrieve it. The creature attacked multiple times, hitting Keyleth, who failed a constitution save and suffered heavy poison damage, and Tiberius, who resisted and retaliated with dragonborn fire breath. Vax’ildan delivered heavy damage through critical sneak attacks. Keyleth used Thunderwave to push the abomination back, then polymorphed into an eagle to retreat. Scanlan inspired the party and cast Lightning Bolt shaped in a “Scanlan-shaped S” pattern, dealing 24 lightning damage and destroying the creature’s multiple sewn-on heads, bursting its eyes, killing it and leaving one head screaming before it collapsed.

Dwarves present witnessed Scanlan’s powerful arcane display and commended him, recognizing the unusual magic. They acknowledged similar terrifying entities have been emerging from the tunnels explored by the party. The episode concluded with celebration and commendations for the players’ performance.

An announcement noted that future Critical Role episodes will air Thursdays at 7:00pm, with this episode airing early due to cast attendance at South by Southwest (SXSW). Crew members expressed excitement for the event with uncertain plans for streaming. Matt Mercer thanked viewers and invited them to return for next week’s session.

Future episodes will include audience donations, with half the proceeds benefiting 826LA, a charity promoting creative youth literacy programs. This session combined intense combat, political intrigue, rich roleplay, and party camaraderie within Kraghammer’s dwarven cultural setting.
