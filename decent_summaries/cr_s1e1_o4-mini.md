Critical Role kicked off its new live-streamed Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition campaign on Thursday at 7:00 p.m. PST via Geek & Sundry (archived there, with a YouTube upload pending). Moving from Pathfinder to a bespoke 5E ruleset that now includes gunslinger mechanics, the cast—minus Ashley Johnson (Pike), who was in London for a BAFTA event—embarked on their first session under Game Master Matthew Mercer. After ironing out initial audio bottlenecks, Mercer confirmed a weekly Thursday schedule and announced a benefit drive for the literacy nonprofit 826LA.

Before play began, six pre-recorded vignettes introduced the rotating eight-player ensemble: Grog Strongjaw (goliath barbarian), Keyleth (Air Ashari druid), Percival “Percy” de Rolo (gunslinger), Scanlan Shorthalt (gnome bard), Tiberius Stormwind (dragonborn sorcerer-diplomat) and half-elf twins Vax’ildan (rogue) and Vex’ahlia (ranger) with their companion bear Trinket. These sequences framed the twins’ exile from Syngorn and ran in parallel with a red dragonborn guild member’s secretive relic hunt.

Picking up after rescuing the fallen city of Emon and erecting a ceremonial keep, the party accepted a commission from Arcanist Allura Vysoren: locate Paladin Kima beneath the dwarven metropolis of Kraghammer. At the city gates they presented Allura’s paperwork, spared former ally Orion—standing in for the absent Pike—and learned that Lord Nostoc Greyspine of House Greyspine oversaw Kraghammer’s prized mithral mine. Carver guards redirected them from the notorious Pig Pits to the Iron Hearth Tavern, where they booked five rooms at 15 gp per night. Barkeep Adra warned of Carver brutality and goblin incursions at the Greyspine Quarry, suggesting that Kima might be posing as a halfling guest at the Firebrook Inn.

That evening Scanlan used Healing Word to save brewery champion Balgus, while Grog bartered a cup of dragon blood for a barrel of four-year-aged dark blood wine—information that pointed them to Greyspine Manor. At dawn, Keyleth and Vax scouted its perimeter as Vax and Vex posed as the wealthy “Howells.” Vax slipped away by a successful DC 21 Stealth check; Vex continued alone. Tiberius attempted to bypass House Thunderbrand’s defensive runes, suffering thunder damage before prevailing on a DC 24 Persuasion roll to free his Carver escort.

Returning to the tavern, the group found dwarves forcing Trinket into a fighting pit. Keyleth cast Fog Cloud, polymorphed Trinket into a rat and Wild Shaped into a bear to fight in his stead; Vax delivered a nonlethal sneak attack on Balgus, and Scanlan’s nat-20 shawm performance earned them bear-sized lodging, comment cards and a boozy dwarven brunch. Over breakfast they debated returning to House Thunderbrand versus pressing onward, sharing laughs about Tiberius’s infamous troll-polymorph mishap.

Armed with an ornate wine cask entwined with ivy and dark blossoms via Druidcraft, they impressed the Carver guards at Greyspine Manor’s gate. Magrim, Lord Greyspine’s disdainful servant, grudgingly directed them to the Greyspine Quarry. That night, Scanlan turned invisible and infiltrated the manor’s upper rooms—discovering finely crafted shawms and a half-finished throne room—but, unable to pick a locked door, escaped via Dimension Door.

At first light the adventurers descended into the quarry’s domed temples, foundry and three deep mining pits ringed by Carver militia. Presenting their transformed wine to Lord Nostoc, Percy’s ceremonial pour secured them guarded passage, along with the stern warning that any theft or trespass would be met with lethal force. Two Carver guards then led them into soot-choked tunnels where fleeing dwarven soldiers were ambushed by goblins. In the ensuing clash Percy’s firearm “Bad News” scored a critical hit on an ogre; Tiberius’s Fireball obliterated the goblins and wounded both ogres before he used Telekinesis; Vex marked and finished one ogre with a Lightning Arrow; Vax slew the second with twin‐dagger sneak attacks; and Grog, raging, drove off the remaining goblins, leaving only two entangled by Keyleth’s earlier magic.

As the mine walls began to collapse, Keyleth sealed the exit with Wall of Stone and intimidated nearby guards, who admitted encountering “strange abominations” deeper below. Suddenly, a colossal five-headed naga burst through the rubble. In a perfectly coordinated assault Tiberius unleashed Scorching Rays, Vex’s Hunter’s Mark-enhanced flaming arrows struck true, Grog hurled his returning-chain greataxe, Vax landed critical sneak attacks, and Keyleth blasted waves of thunder before Wild Shaping into an eagle. Scanlan finished the creature with a devastating Lightning Bolt, obliterating it. Post-battle, Scanlan crawled along the naga’s spine, using a final Lightning Bolt to splinter its sutures and sever all but one head, which exploded in a brilliant burst shaped like a stylized “S,” leaving a scorch mark in his image. The awed dwarven militia applauded, and one vowed to relay the tale to Pike.

In the epilogue the cast traded in-character reactions as Mercer declared the session over. The crew cheered, camera operator Zac quipped about on-set stress, and Mercer reminded viewers that the next live stream returns Thursday at 7:00 p.m. PST. With South by Southwest on the horizon and future streaming dates to be announced, Mercer and the cast offered final thanks and signed off.
