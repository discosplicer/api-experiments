Critical Role is a weekly, house-ruled Dungeons & Dragons 5E livestream hosted by Matthew Mercer, airing Thursdays at 7:00 pm on Geek & Sundry’s Twitch (with archives available). In this inaugural session, Vox Machina—Grog Strongjaw (goliath barbarian), Keyleth (Air Ashari druid), Percy de Rolo (noble inventor/rogue), Scanlan Shorthalt (gnome bard), Tiberius Stormwind (dragonborn sorcerer), and twins Vax’ildan (rogue) & Vex’ahlia (ranger), accompanied by Trinket the bear—accept Archmage Allura Vysoren’s commission to rescue Lady Kima of Vord from Kraghammer, a vast dwarven city carved from glowing red stone.

Their investigation begins at the Iron Hearth Tavern, where free ale earns them dwarven goodwill and crucial intelligence: Ironkeeper Gradim Greyspine chairs the city council, his cousin Lord Nostoc oversees the mithral mines, goblins and worse spill from the Keystone Quarry, and House Thunderbrand holds an arcane monopoly. To prepare, Tiberius infiltrates House Thunderbrand—surviving a rune-ward shock trap and bluffing past wardens—while Vax and Vex scout Lord Nostoc’s manor and find no secret entrances. In the tavern’s brawling ring, Keyleth’s Fog Cloud plus Wild Shape, Vax’s nonlethal sneak attack, and Scanlan’s miniature-Trinket rescue win champion Balgus’s admiration, securing five rooms and access to a vault.

Over a dwarven brunch the party parley with Lord Nostoc under the guise of “Tiberius Kraghammer,” passing the guards’ sobriety test with swigs of ale. Percy poses as a servant while Scanlan scouts invisibly. Impressed by the sealed cask, Nostoc grudgingly grants passage into the crimson-lit mithral shafts—warning that any deceit will be met with force. There they find wounded miners, swarming goblins, and two ogre-like brutes. Keyleth entangles the goblins; Tiberius’s Fireball disintegrates many and Telekinesis slams an ogre into its companion; Vex’s Hunter’s Mark arrows and Grog’s raging greataxe down goblins; Vax flanks and executes the remaining brutes with twin-dagger sneak attacks. With foes defeated, Keyleth seals the entrance with Wall of Stone. The goblin guards reveal only that “strange abominations” lie below.

Moments later a grotesque, bulbous naga-like monstrosity with five crudely stitched-on heads bursts through. In swift initiative order: Tiberius’s Scorching Ray—one ray on a natural 20—and Vex’s hunter’s-marked arrows pummel the creature; Grog hurls his returning greataxe; the abomination retaliates with fang attacks, three of which strike Keyleth (Stoneskin mitigating most before a failed poison save inflicts 31 damage) and one grazing Tiberius. Vax reappears to land two Sneak Attack criticals that tear its stitches. Keyleth unleashes Thunderwave and then Wild Shapes into an eagle to recover. Finally, Scanlan channels a self-inspired Lightning Bolt—Matt narrates it as crawling arcane energy, splintering sutures, sloughing off heads, and burning an “S”-shaped bolt into the beast’s torso—to deliver the coup de grâce. Dwarven bystanders lower their crossbows, step forward to congratulate the gnome (one even patting him on the shoulder), and peer into the tunnel, remarking on the horrors emerging from below.

Bloodied but victorious, Vox Machina stands ready to plunge deeper into Kraghammer’s Underdark in search of their missing ally. Amid cheers from players and audience, Mercer thanks viewers for joining the first-ever Critical Role livestream, announces next week’s session at the same time, and the team—Zac joking about camera stress and imminent travel to South by Southwest—signs off, leaving the adventure poised to continue.
