Building upon the prior detailed overview, this codebase represents a sophisticated integration of emulator internals with advanced AI language models to facilitate autonomous gameplay, environment mapping, navigation, and multi-session interaction within a gaming environment.

The system begins by importing an extensive set of libraries required for diverse functions, including fundamental modules such as base64, copy, io, and json; advanced numerical and image processing via numpy and PIL’s ImageDraw, ImageFilter, and Image; system utilities like os, threading, time, and pickle for concurrency and persistence; as well as specialized API clients for major language models including Anthropic’s CLAUDE, OpenAI, and Google’s GEMINI. Constants such as BASE_IMAGE_SIZE (160x144 tiles) and MAX_TOKENS_OPENAI (50,000 tokens) standardize spatial dimensions and token management across the system.

At the core of environment representation lies the `LocationCollisionMap` class, which manages a numeric grid encoding tile states with specific codes for unknown (-1), passable (1), impassable (0), sprites (2), and the player’s current position (3). It dynamically incorporates emulator collision data and real-time sprite locations to maintain an accurate map. Employing a breadth-first search (BFS)-style algorithm, it computes distances from the player to all tiles and generates sequences of simulated controller button presses to navigate toward specified coordinates. For enhanced visualization and debugging, it can produce detailed ASCII maps with legends that illustrate explored areas, obstacles, sprites, player position, and annotated distances, supporting spatial awareness and troubleshooting.

The `TextDisplay` class complements this by managing a rolling buffer of recent textual messages, with a configurable depth, and ensures continuous logging to an external “text_output.txt” file. This allows for real-time monitoring and archival of textual interactions throughout gameplay.

Central to the system is the `SimpleAgent` class. It initializes with multiple configurable parameters such as the game ROM path, options for headless or sound-disabled modes, message history limits, flags for loading saved emulator and location states, and threading support. The agent controls the emulator instance directly and conditionally initializes API clients based on the current MODEL environment variable, supporting OpenAI, CLAUDE, or GEMINI. Internally, it maintains comprehensive message histories, location trackers, collision maps, navigation data, and a `TextDisplay` instance for output logging.

Persistence is robustly supported. The agent can serialize and restore emulator states and location archives, with backward compatibility for legacy archive formats. A key method, `get_screenshot_base64`, captures emulator screenshots as PIL images, converts them into base64-encoded PNG strings (with optional upscaling), overlays a 9-by-10 tile grid centered around the player (excluding the player’s tile), and annotates tiles based on their content—labeling them as “NPC/OBJECT,” “IMPASSABLE,” “EXPLORED,” “RECENTLY VISITED,” or “CHECK HERE.” Font sizes adjust dynamically based on the active model to optimize readability. For debugging, these annotated images are temporarily saved as "test.png," though this feature is planned for removal.

For message history management, methods such as `save_location_archive` and `load_location_archive` handle serialization and restoration of critical state components including collision maps, trackers, label dictionaries, visitation histories, messages, and checkpoints. The agent cleans message histories by removing recent complex, non-string tool usages that could complicate processing. It uses a static method `strip_text_map_and_images_from_history` to replace embedded large images and textual maps in the message history with placeholder text, optimizing token usage and memory.

The collision maps are dynamically updated by combining emulator collision data with real-time sprite locations to ensure a comprehensive environmental snapshot. Location labels and coordinates can be retrieved by place name, including a case-insensitive fallback to facilitate flexible querying.

Player interaction is simulated via the `press_buttons` method, which emulates controller inputs within the emulator, then updates internal state including player coordinates, memory snapshots, collision maps, visitation history, and marks visited tiles on the location tracker grid. After these actions, extensive logging of memory states and collision maps aids transparency and debugging.

The `process_tool_call` method is crucial for handling high-level command processing, adapting behavior depending on the underlying language model. It parses input and call IDs accordingly and supports a variety of tool calls:

- **press_buttons**: Executes specified controller button presses with optional wait instructions.

- **navigate_to**: Calculates paths to target on-screen coordinates, simulates sequential movements along this path, updates navigation tracking and visitation, logs emulator state and collision maps, fetches nearby labeled locations, and returns detailed navigation results with optional annotated screenshots and maps. Outputs are formatted per model (CLAUDE, GEMINI, OPENAI) and operational modes such as detailed navigation or combat.

- **navigate_to_offscreen_coordinate**: Enables navigation to offscreen coordinates by validating their presence in the full collision map and either autonomously generating button presses or collaborating with language models for guided stepwise navigation before executing commands and returning results.

- **bookmark_location_or_overwrite_label**: Stores or modifies labels and coordinates for in-game locations, confirming the action via logs.

- **mark_checkpoint**: Resets step counters, temporarily disables location tracking, logs checkpoint information including achievement descriptions, and confirms checkpoint setting.

- **navigation_assistance** (currently unused): Intended to generate textual navigation guidance based on player goals.

- **detailed_navigator**: Activates a detailed navigator mode in the agent, initializes associated navigation messages, and confirms mode activation.

Any unrecognized tool calls are met with error logging and prompt error messages returned.

Response formatting is carefully adapted for each language model’s specific requirements, embedding relevant text, tool call data, screenshots, and collision maps as appropriate.

The main agent loop supports flexible parameters such as step counts, save intervals and paths, and threading options. If launched on the main PyBoy emulator thread without threading, the agent runs asynchronously in a separate thread to avoid blocking. It logs startup and waits for PyBoy readiness, optionally loads saved states, and iterates while active and within step limits.

During each iteration, the player’s location and coordinates are retrieved. New locations are logged and archived while updating the last known coordinates. In detailed navigator mode—when outside of combat—the loop appends navigator messages, captures and annotates screenshots (converted to base64), and enriches navigation message history with ASCII collision maps, screenshots, and stepwise navigation instructions. Otherwise, the standard message history is stripped of large images and textual maps to reduce token use.

Recent user messages are marked ephemeral to lessen memory load and manage token consumption effectively. The agent interacts with CLAUDE, GEMINI, and OPENAI models with tailored message formatting, including retries on transient errors. From the generated model output, it extracts reasoning sections, tool calls, replies, and logs token usage.

Assistant messages are appended to the internal history. Any tool calls returned by the models are processed accordingly, with the emulator and internal state updated, and formatted tool results added into the conversation history, including warnings if tool calls are malformed.

Message histories for navigator modes are carefully pruned to remove orphaned tool results and calls, preserving a clean input context. An agentic summary process is invoked when message length or token utilization surpasses certain thresholds. This summarization consolidates game state, memory data, environment maps, checkpoints, and labels into a detailed textual digest via staged prompting, with output saved for future reference.

If the model produces no actionable tool calls, the system automatically prompts continuation of gameplay. Multiple counters are tracked diligently—absolute steps, steps since checkpoint, label resets, location shifts—which in turn trigger behaviors such as enabling detailed navigator mode after prolonged inactivity or reinitializing navigation messages when thresholds are met.

Location tracking activates after a set number of steps post-checkpoint. Approximate entrances and new locations are logged and archived as they occur. Upon reaching new goal locations differing from targets, detailed navigator mode is deactivated. The system periodically clears non-approximate labels to remove potentially inaccurate information, with frequency adjusted per active model.

Emulator state, archives, and milestones are saved periodically or upon exit, with all step counts logged. The emulator halts as needed during agent stop operations or when running in main thread configurations.

The agent supports iterative navigation by simulating sequential button presses along computed paths and offers dedicated navigation assistance functionality, leveraging current mapping, labeled locations, and navigation objectives to generate precise next-step advice.

The `prompt_text_reply` method enables response generation from various models with support for message history inclusion and screenshot embedding. It incorporates model-specific format conversions, robust retry logic against server errors or content filters, and detailed extraction of text output.

Robust error handling throughout the code includes extensive logging and breakpoint triggers to assist with diagnostics in unexpected conditions.

A final snippet of the code illustrates assembling a message history with both textual summaries and base64-encoded screenshots for interaction with OpenAI’s API. It integrates the current gameplay screenshot as an embedded image and includes a prompt inviting continuation by selecting the next action after summarizing the playthrough. The snippet shows the setup and execution of the main agent run cycle with logging of completed steps, graceful handling of interrupts, and proper cleanup via a `stop()` method that halts the agent and emulator.

In summary, this comprehensive codebase intricately couples emulator internals with multiple cutting-edge AI language models to enable a powerful autonomous agent within a game environment. It encompasses detailed environment mapping via BFS pathfinding, precise player tracking, autonomous navigation command generation, persistent multi-session textual logging, and advanced visual debugging through annotated screenshots. All components operate within a threaded execution framework that supports multiple AI backends and robust gameplay assistance, forming a rich and extensible system for autonomous exploration and interaction.
