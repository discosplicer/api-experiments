A live-streamed, one-shot session of Critical Role opened as Scanlan Shorthalt, Keyleth Ashari, Percy de Rolo, Grog Strongjaw, Vex’ahlia, Vax’ildan and Tiberius Stormwind answered Arcanist Allura Vysoren’s summons to recover the missing paladin Lady Kima of Vord from the fractured depths of Kraghammer. After securing rooms and a full long rest at the Iron Hearth Tavern—during which Keyleth tended Trinket and Percy’s prototype bolo-trigger arrow shattered—the party descended past ichor-soaked corpses. Guided by Foreman Hieris’s hand-drawn map, they bypassed collapsed passages to a deep wooden lift lit by Scanlan’s Light spell.

Deep beneath the city, they tracked a multi-headed naga-hydra into a vast cavern. Scanlan’s lightning bolt shattered its central skull, drawing cheers from the dwarven Carvers, who then escorted the adventurers to Lord Nostoc Greyspine’s subterranean office. There the party secured a contract: twenty-five thousand gold up-front, 250 gp per beast scalp, unrestricted mine access and noninterference by the guards, in exchange for any trace of Lady Kima. Greyspine recounted six weeks of grotesque aberrations—composite goblins, rapidly mutating oozes, a swollen, multi-mawed duergar and surface beasts dragged underground—reported one Carver slain, confirmed no hidden passages, and provided an updated map warning of shifting tunnels.

Following a brief celebration at the Barrel of Balgus—where Scanlan earned an inspiration die—the group spent 7,200 gp at Tremaine’s Value of Valor on superior and greater healing potions, sleep arrows and water-breathing elixirs, negotiating future discounts for arcane relics and inquiring after the fabled Pale Stone and a mithril elven chain shirt. Their petition to House Thunderbrand’s dwarf arcanist ended in frustration when a fourteen-point lightning ward foiled their Dispel Magic (Arcana 13) and persuasion and disguise checks catastrophically failed; the arcanist promised aid only once certain enchanted items were retrieved from the mine.

With objectives clear—to recover those enchanted items, stem the aberrant incursions and, if fortune permitted, rescue Lady Kima—the party pressed into unmapped depths. Two umber hulks dropped from the ceiling in a surprise ambush, their confusing gaze mauling Percy and Grog. Scanlan’s Cutting Words lessened some harm, and his Healing Word patched Percy’s wounds. Vex and Percy struck despite disadvantage; Keyleth wild-shaped into a cave bear, grappled one hulk and dragged it underwater. Scanlan cast Polymorph on the central hulk, transforming it into a tiny snail. Tiberius freed Grog from confusion with Dispel Magic, and in a feral Rage Grog tore through the grappled hulk, its force shattering the snail’s form. A second full-size hulk emerged; Vex’s Hunter’s Mark guided two precise arrow shots, while Tiberius, Quickened, cast Grand Column to secure high ground. Combat raged amid cramped positioning and waterfall hazards until initiative reset.

Emerging beyond the hulks, the party found a smoldering campfire and makeshift bedding—then three ash-grey duergar and a large, brain-like aberration opened fire, striking Grog with crossbow bolts. Initiative was rolled. Vex and Vax slipped into hiding at disadvantage while Scanlan advanced and cast Stinking Cloud; all four duergar and their aberrant ally failed their Constitution saves and retched helplessly. Scanlan quaffed a greater healing potion as Percy and Keyleth repositioned; Keyleth readied Call Lightning after learning that Wall of Stone could not occupy a creature’s space.

The aberrant brain creature moved out of the cloud and unleashed a psychic assault: Grog failed his Intelligence save, took heavy psychic damage and fell catatonic with his intelligence reduced to zero. Tiberius immediately fired a Glacial Blast; though the creature succeeded on its save, it still suffered 29 cold damage and shattered. Vex then loosed two arrows—one amplified by Hunter’s Mark—skewering a duergar and collapsing it. Scanlan’s Dispel Magic failed to end Grog’s catatonia, so he expended his inspiration die to bolster Vax. Percy’s hand crossbow delivered a critical hit, incapacitating a second duergar by exposing its bone, and Keyleth’s lightning bolt outside the cloud charred and deafened the third, though it remained standing. Both surviving duergar continued retching, and Vax’s attempt to take a duergar hostage was thwarted by coughing. Tiberius and Vex then dispatched the final duergar; Vex’s arrow knocked it off a ledge. Shouting a surrender command in Undercommon, Vex compelled the last duergar to drop weapons and kneel despite a low Intimidation roll.

The party debated healing Grog. The GM ruled that while standard healing spells could mend his wounds, only a restoration-level magic could reverse his catatonic state. The session closed with a duergar captive in tow and Grog incapacitated, the adventurers poised for their next descent. In post-game remarks, the cast celebrated reaching 1,000 Twitch subscribers and announced upcoming streams and after-show content, including a Hotline Miami 2 playthrough and the next tabletop event, Gather Your Party.
