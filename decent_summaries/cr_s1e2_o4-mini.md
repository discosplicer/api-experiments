Arcanist Allura Vysoren summons the party to Kraghammer with a single, urgent charge: infiltrate the Greyspine Mines and rescue the missing paladin Lady Kima of Vord. Beneath the city’s stout walls, the adventurers drive back a goblin–ogre horde under a naga–hydra’s command when Scanlan’s crackling Lightning Bolt severs the beast, scattering its forces. Grateful, Lord Nostoc Greyspine grants them unrestricted access to every tunnel—so long as they post a 25,000 gp retainer, turn in 250 gp for each recovered beast scalp, and refrain from delivering any severed hydra heads. Foreman Hieris furnishes a chalk map detailing collapsed galleries, barred passages, and lurking dangers—stitched-together goblins, color-shifting oozes, and whispers of a multi-mouthed duergar broodmaster—and confirms that Lady Kima lies in the mine’s deepest levels.

Before descending, the party reprovisions in Kraghammer’s magic quarter. At House Thunderbrand, Tiberius attempts to Dispel the dwarven runic wards but is repelled and shocked for 14 lightning damage; the arcanist withholds further cooperation until promised powerful artifacts. At the incense-scented Value of Valor they invest 4,200 gp (gold only) in nine Greater Healing Potions, two Sleep Arrows, and two Potions of Water Breathing—and learn that the fabled Pale Stone may yet be appraised there.

At dawn they return to the mine, first stocking up on pickaxes, shovels, timber, and nails before boarding a groaning wooden chain-lift into utter darkness lit only by Tiberius’s ever-glowing orb. In the bottom ring they find a spiral stone staircase, a side minecart track, and two solemn dwarven miners dragging mixed corpses toward a freshly blasted 20×15-foot breach. Keyleth’s keen eyes detect deep drag marks, dwarven footprints, minimal blood spatter, and two headless, printless bodies—proof they’re on the right path. Four hours of stale-air galleries later, the party emerges into a vast cavern whose underground river spills into a hidden pool. Before they can advance, giant spiders crash from above and two massive umber hulks stagger into view, one’s confusing gaze freezing Vex in place.

Reacting swiftly, Scanlan bolsters allies with Cutting Words and transforms himself into a tiny snail to distract the hulks, while Tiberius’s Arcana-aided strike and Orion’s Grand Column grant height advantage. Vex’s marked bowshots and Percy’s jam-clearing Fire Shot pick away at their flanks as Keyleth, in bear form, grapples one hulk and drags it underwater. Vax hurls the snail distraction into the water current, and Grog’s frenzied cleave seals the first creature’s fate—its severed head swept downriver. When a third hulk bursts from the wall, Tiberius’s Firebolt misfires, but Vex’s disadvantage shots—one bearing Hunter’s Mark—land true. Scanlan’s Lightning Bolt, Percy’s disadvantage shots, and Keyleth’s Call Lightning finish the beast; Vax’s flanking dagger strikes deliver the killing blow. After curing Scanlan’s wounds, the party hears the distant flicker of torchlight ahead.

Grog rushes forward in his frenzy only to stumble on a concealed campfire, triggering an ambush by three duergar crossbowmen and a strange, brain-like panther—“Jeff Lobey.” The mind beast’s psychic assault hurls Grog to the ground, inflicting 9 psychic and 8 Intelligence damage and rendering him unconscious with his Int reduced to zero. Tiberius retaliates with Glacial Blast, shattering Jeff Lobey beneath a spray of ice, while Vex positions herself to loose two arrows—each empowered by Hunter’s Mark—killing the first duergar. A stinking cloud from Vex forces the remaining duergar and their third companion to retch and collapse, while Percy’s precise shot incapacitates the second with a shattered shoulder. Keyleth advances, unleashing a Lightning Bolt that strikes the final duergar for 22 thunder damage. Vax attempts to hold the wounded captive but is knocked prone by his own coughing fit. Scanlan’s Dispel Magic fails to rouse Grog, and Tiberius’s follow-up Firebolt misses. Vex’s final arrow fells the last duergar as she tumbles over a ledge, then issues a surrender command in Undercommon. The sole survivor drops her weapons.

As the dust settles, the party pours healing energy into Grog’s battered body, mending his wounds even as his catatonic state endures. With one duergar captive and Lady Kima still imprisoned beyond the next cavern, the adventurers steel themselves for the decisive battle to come.
