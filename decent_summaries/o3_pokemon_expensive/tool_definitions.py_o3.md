File tool_definitions.py Summarized: 

The Python module establishes a comprehensive catalogue of tools for a Game Boy-playing agent and then prepares that catalogue for use with both Google Generative AI and OpenAI clients. In its master list, named AVAILABLE_TOOLS, six tools are enabled: press_buttons, navigate_to, navigate_to_offscreen_coordinate, bookmark_location_or_overwrite_label, mark_checkpoint, and detailed_navigator. Each tool entry is presented with two key elements: a human-readable description that explains the tool’s purpose and a JSON-Schema object that rigorously specifies and validates the tool’s input parameters.

Although a seventh tool called navigation_assistance is defined inside a multiline string, it remains inactive because the string is never evaluated as code, leaving the running configuration with only the six active tools. The module offers two helper functions, convert_tool_defs_to_google_format and convert_tool_defs_to_openai_format, which translate the master tool list into the exact data structures required by the respective providers. The translated outputs are stored as GOOGLE_TOOLS and OPENAI_TOOLS.

To avoid recursive calls and prevent unintended clearing of logs, the script also produces trimmed collections that exclude detailed_navigator and mark_checkpoint. These navigator-only subsets—held in NAVIGATOR_TOOLS along with their Google and OpenAI variants—are meant for specialized navigation tasks. For scenarios that require only basic directional control, the module defines DISTANT_NAVIGATOR_BUTTONS, a minimal version of press_buttons restricted to the four cardinal directions and enforced to wait after each press; this limited definition is likewise converted for both Google Generative AI and OpenAI consumption.
