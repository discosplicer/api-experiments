Notes from the Underground opens with an Author’s Note presenting a two-part fictional confession. In Part I (“Underground”), a forty-year-old ex–Petersburg civil servant—sickly, convinced he has a “diseased liver,” spiteful yet secretly kind—recounts the petty cruelties he once inflicted with ironic amusement. Beneath his calculated torments lies shame-bound kindness; he admits that his moral degradation gratifies a vanity that craves an audience. Rejecting the “stone walls” of natural law, rational self-interest and mathematics, he champions irrational revolt—“twice two makes five”—and portrays suffering (via toothache and pain metaphors) as a malicious pleasure and the truest form of freedom. He delivers a scathing critique of Enlightenment optimism, utopian “crystal palaces,” and faith in reason, arguing they breed boredom and capricious rebellion. Ultimately, he concedes that this grand philosophical posturing is a private experiment to discipline his thoughts, exorcise memories, and banish boredom.

Part II (“À Propos of the Wet Snow”) casts us into his twenty-four-year-old self, isolated, hyper-self-conscious, scornful of “decent men” as cowardly slaves and convinced only beasts possess true courage. After an officer’s silent shove in a billiard room, he obsessively traces the man’s identity, drafts an unprinted satire, and issues a duel challenge—only to charge deliriously in borrowed finery and collapse, racked by illness and remorse at Anton Syetotchkin’s flat. At Zverkov’s farewell dinner in the Hôtel de Paris, penniless, he polishes his boots, endures mocking courtesy, then delivers a feverish toast condemning empty pleasantries and corrupt manners, provoking laughter and another declined duel. Undeterred, he borrows more money, hurtles through wet snow in a frantic sledge to Olympia’s salon, oscillates between heroic fantasy and paralyzing shame, and collapses alone in a deserted drawing room before dawn.

In a brothel back room he meets Liza, a beaten twenty-year-old forced into prostitution. After oppressive silence he quizzes her background, fixates on a coffin from the basement and the flooded graves at Volkovo Cemetery, and warns that continued prostitution leads only to disease, scorn, and ignominious death. Shifting abruptly to sentimental moralizing, he paints an ideal father–daughter bond and “heavenly happiness” of marriage, only for Liza to retort that he “speaks like a book.” Stung, he launches a vivid diatribe condemning her “sale of soul,” invoking debt, violence, disease, scorn and death; he watches her convulse, hesitates, then meekly lights a candle, apologizes, and gives her his address. She departs clutching a love-letter from a Riga medical student, affirming her worth.

Walking home through the falling snow, he wrestles with the “loathsome truth” of his own motives. By morning he dismisses his sentimentality as “womanish hysteria,” borrows fifteen roubles, and sends Simonov a polished apology via Apollon—enclosing six roubles to his former comrades—which restores his reputation but leaves him inexplicably guilty. That evening, tormented by Liza’s promised visit and his shabby lodgings, he vacillates between romantic fantasies of rescuing her and mocking his own “damned romanticism.” When Liza arrives, he prolongs an oppressive silence to magnify her embarrassment, then erupts in rage—confessing he came to humiliate her out of wounded pride—overwhelming her into collapse. He paces, denouncing himself as a vain scoundrel craving power; when she impulsively embraces him, he responds with mixed passion and a desire for dominance. In genuine tears they briefly share grief, but he recoils in shame and envy of her emotional openness. From behind a screen he spitefully taps to remind her who controls them both, then thrusts a five-rouble note into her hand. Regretting the act, he rushes outside to find she has flung it back; alone in the snowy street he debates whether to return and beg forgiveness or leave her to the “purifying force” of enduring resentment.

Back in his lodgings he reflects on “cheap happiness versus exalted sufferings,” convinced that hatred may ennoble Liza more than fulfilled love. He closes the Notes with a broader indictment: modern men, alienated from real life and addicted to books and abstractions, crave external control and are thus doomed to moral rot.
