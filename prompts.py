META_KNOWLEDGE_PROMPT = """
Write down a list of bullet points about the provided text. You will be given a previous summary of any text that came before the
current one for additional context. Your job is solely to summarize and not to make any subjective judgments or interpretations.

META_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
You are an AI that improves and corrects the output of another AI. The other AI has provided a list of bullet points about a chunk of text,
along with a previous summary of the text that came before the chunk. Your task is to refine the previous summary with new information. You must treat the previous summary as correct
unless you have strong evidence to the contrary or the new text contradicts it.

Note that the previous summary does not contain information about all of the bullet points, as some come from a new chunk of text.

Your task is to take the previous summary and output it again, removing the least relevant information and adding any information
contained in the bullet points that is not already in the previous summary. You should not add any new information that is not in the bullet points.
"""

META_CLEANUP_PROMPT = """
You are an AI that improves the output of another AI. The other AI has provided a summary of a text. You will be given
the text, the previous summary, and a list of bullet points that summarizes the text so far including the previous text
that generated the previous summary and the new text.

Your task is to output the exact same list of bullet points excluding any unncessary, incorrect, or irrelevant points.
Leave all other bullet points completely unchanged. One exception is that if two different bullet points say the same thing
in two different ways, you should combine them into one bullet point that is more concise.
