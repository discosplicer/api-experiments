Matthew Mercer, voice actor and Dungeon Master for Critical Role on Geek & Sundry, leads a weekly streamed Dungeons & Dragons game featuring voice actors playing mostly homebrew rules based on D&D 5th edition, airing Thursdays at 7:00 pm PST with character backstory videos to aid viewers.

The party includes Grog Strongjaw, a goliath barbarian exiled from his herd; Keyleth, a half-elven druid on a tribal quest called the Aramente; Percy, a noble-born gunslinger seeking vengeance with his firearm "Bad News"; Scanlan Shorthalt, a charming gnome bard; Tiberius Stormwind, a red dragonborn sorcerer researching legendary artifacts; and twins Vax'ildan and Vex'ahlia, half-elven rogue and ranger respectively, with Vex accompanied by her bear Trinket. Ashley Johnson (Pike) is currently absent.

Continuing their story after saving Emon, the party journeys to Kraghammer, a vast multi-tiered underground dwarven city built into a mountain, entering with official paperwork and interacting with the Carvers, the city’s law enforcement. They seek lodging at the Iron Hearth Tavern, managed by Adra, and learn about local politics involving House Greyspine, the ruling family controlling the mines and city council. The party investigates the troubled Keystone Quarry, a mithral mine owned by Nostoc Greyspine, where recent troubles and monster sightings have occurred.

They cautiously explore, balancing diplomacy and stealth. The group negotiates alliances, notably with Balgus, a grumpy, partly drunk dwarf brewery owner, trading a rare bloodthistle dark wine barrel for a cup of dragon blood. They plan further reconnaissance around Greyspine Manor and House Thunderbrand, navigating social dynamics with guarded locals and heavy security.

Inside Greyspine Manor, Scanlan uses invisibility to explore richly decorated rooms but refrains from stealing a finely crafted shawm. Locked doors and the presence of the Ironkeeper restrict access, and after some failed attempts, Scanlan uses Dimension Door to exit. The party then heads to the mines to meet Nostoc, presenting an ale gift decorated to dwarven tastes. Nostoc ceremoniously drinks, asserts dominance, and discusses a halfling troublemaker trespassing in the mines. The party offers to find this halfling to mend relations and is allowed passage.

As they depart, alarm bells signal unusual activity at the quarry. The party follows guards to find fleeing dwarves and goblin attackers. They engage in combat using coordinated tactics, spells (Entangle, Fireball, Stoneskin, Scorching Ray, Thunderwave), and powerful weapons, including Percy’s gun "Bad News." They quickly defeat goblins and ogres, maintaining teamwork and strategic focus.

The party uses a Wall of Stone to temporarily seal a mine entrance, while dwarven guards watch cautiously. Keyleth attempts to intimidate the guards to learn what is coming, who report strange, stitched-together abominations emerging. Soon, a massive abomination-like naga with five different colored heads bursts through the stone wall, initiating combat.

Combat unfolds with precise ranged and magical attacks from party members. Grog throws his chained greataxe and successfully retrieves it. The naga attacks multiple party members with its heads, inflicting physical and poison damage; Keyleth critically fails a poison saving throw, suffering significant damage. Vax expertly delivers critical hits with daggers. Keyleth retaliates with Thunderwave and shapeshifts into an eagle to retreat. Scanlan inspires himself and casts a powerful Lightning Bolt, dramatically killing the naga. The dwarves acknowledge the party’s victory with respect and gratitude.

The session concludes with announcements about the show’s schedule and upcoming events.
